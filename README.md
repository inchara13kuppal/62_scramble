# PES1UG25CS818 - Word Scramble Repair Lab

## claude link: https://claude.ai/share/207cd5bb-5fc4-4dac-b066-dbaf19b4cead

This project is an interactive anagram deduction word puzzle game using **Pygame**. It introduces students to string permutation, randomized list shuffling, uppercase letter sanitization, and text-box widget integration within an object-oriented codebase.

## What's Provided

A working Word Scramble game with:

- A built-in dictionary pool of words chosen at random each round
- A scrambling algorithm that randomizes letter order while ensuring the scrambled version differs from the original word
- A custom `TextBox` input component handling alphabetic keystrokes, automatic uppercase conversion, and backspace[cite: 34, 35]
- Interactive guess submission via the `Return` / `Enter` key or clicking the `SUBMIT` button
- Real-time score tracking, spaced letter displays, and color-coded status messaging

It has **one deliberate bug** and **three optional features** left as tasks to implement. You are expected to **analyze**, **interact with an AI assistant**, and **complete/fix** the game to make it fully functional and more interesting.

### **Use an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT or Claude) as your debugging and pair-programming partner for this lab.**

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Controls:** Type letters into the text box and press Return (or click SUBMIT) to submit your unscrambled word


## Tasks to Complete

Each task must be completed using an iterative process involving LLM suggestions and your critical code review.

### Task 1: Fix the guess comparison validation bug

When the player figures out the correct unscrambled word and types it into the text box, the game rejects it with a "WRONG GUESS! Try again." error. In game_engine.submit_guess(), the validation line checks is_correct = (guess == self.scrambled_word) instead of comparing the guess to self.secret_word. This erroneously forces the player to re-type the jumbled letters rather than unscrambling the word. Fix the equality check so guess is validated against self.secret_word.

### Task 2: Implement a hint system with letter reveals

Some long words can be challenging to unscramble. Add a clickable HINT button beside SUBMIT. When clicked, reveal the first unrevealed letter of self.secret_word in its correct position (e.g., displaying P _ _ _ _ _ for PYTHON), while deducting a small point penalty from self.score.
 
### Task 3: Implement a round countdown timer

Currently, players have unlimited time to ponder each word. Add an active countdown timer bar (e.g., 20 seconds) in game_engine.render(). If the timer expires before a correct guess is entered, reveal the correct secret word, display a "TIME'S UP!" warning, and transition automatically to self.next_round().

### Task 4: Implement letter tile drag-and-drop or clickable letter sorting

Instead of reading scrambled letters as a static text string, render each scrambled letter inside its own graphical square tile. Allow players to click or drag tiles into a rearrangement rack to experiment with different anagram configurations before submitting.

## Expected Behavior

- At the start of each round, a word is chosen and displayed with its letters jumbled.
- Typing the correctly unscrambled word into the input box awards 1 point, displays a success message, and advances to a new word.
- Typing an incorrect word displays a warning message and clears the input box for retry without advancing the round.
- Empty submissions trigger a prompt without penalty.

## Submission Checklist

Submission is only the following three things:

- [] A 10-second video of gameplay **before** your changes, showing the bug/broken behavior
- [] A 10-second video of gameplay **after** your changes, showing the bug fixed and the new features working
- [] The Chat/LLM used page link, with the complete chat history
